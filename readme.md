# Co-SAM: Continual Learning for Segment Anything Model Adaptation

CoSAM (Continual Segmentation Adaptation Model) is a deep learning framework designed to enhance segmentation models by incorporating continual learning techniques to adapt dynamically to new, unseen domains without forgetting previously learned information.

## Project Background

Traditional segmentation models often struggle with domain shifts that render them less effective outside their training environments. CoSAM addresses this limitation by integrating state-of-the-art continual learning strategies, enabling the model to maintain high performance across a range of challenging segmentation scenarios.

## Installation

To set up a local development environment, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CoSAM.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd CoSAM

# Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
